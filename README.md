 #CognoRise Infotech Python Development Internship
Task Completion
I have complated tasks of the CognoRise Infotech Python Development Internship!

Task 1: Hangman Game
In Task 1, I implemented a Hangman game using Python. I successfully created a game that selects a random word from a predefined list, prompts the user for letter guesses, displays the hangman figure and word state, checks the guessed letters, and determines win or loss conditions. The user interface was designed to provide clear instructions and feedback, enhancing the overall user experience.

Task 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
For Task 2, I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. I created a game that prompts users to select rock, paper, or scissors, generates the computer's choice, determines the winner based on user and computer selections, and displays the results. I also implemented score tracking for multiple rounds and provided an option for users to play again.

Task 3: Password Generator
Task 3 involved creating a Password Generator application using Python. I successfully designed a tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. The application allows users to specify the length and complexity of the password, generates a password of the specified length using random characters, and displays the generated password on the screen.

Task 4: QR Code Encoder/Decoder
Finally, in Task 4, I implemented a QR Code Encoder/Decoder tool using Python. I developed a tool that generates QR codes for information like URLs or texts and decodes QR codes to retrieve the embedded data. By utilizing libraries like qrcode and opencv-python, I enhanced my practical skills in image processing and data encoding, showcasing the power of Python in data representation and extraction through QR codes.
